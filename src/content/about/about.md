I spend my days as a co-founder and software engineer at Admiral, where we're
focused on building a more sustainable future for digital publishers. I'm
passionate about turning complex ideas into elegant, functional code and
architecting systems that can stand the test of scale.

This is where I get into the weeds of specific engineering problems I've solved,
from tackling performance bottlenecks to designing scalable new features. I'll
also post walkthroughs and explorations of new techologies as I learn them.
Whether you're a developer, an entrepreneur, or just curious, I hope you'll find
something useful and interesting.
